## Background
As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I am tasked with analyzing district-wide standardized test results to aid strategic decision-making regarding school budgets and priorities. Utilizing Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, my assignment is to create detailed reports based on every student's math and reading scores, along with school information. The objective is to aggregate this data effectively to reveal clear trends in school performance. This analysis will help in creating a comprehensive snapshot of the district's educational landscape, encompassing various key metrics like average scores, passing percentages, and budget allocations. The insights gained will be pivotal in guiding the school board and mayor's decisions, ensuring resource allocation aligns with the areas of greatest need and impact.
## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to utilize advanced data manipulation techniques with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to conduct a thorough analysis of standardized test results across the school district. The key objectives are outlined as follows:
1. **District Summary**: To compute and present a high-level snapshot of the district's key educational metrics, including the total number of schools, students, overall budget, average scores, and percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
2. **School Summary**: To create a detailed report for each school, covering metrics such as school type, total students, budget allocations, average scores, and passing rates. This will provide a clear understanding of each school's performance within the district.
3. **Performance Analysis by Various Criteria**:
	* **Highest-Performing Schools**: Identify and list the top schools based on overall passing rates.
	* **Lowest-Performing Schools**: Determine schools that need the most attention and improvement.
	* **Math and Reading Scores by Grade**: Analyze average scores in math and reading across different grade levels for each school.
	* **Scores by School Spending**: Examine how school performance correlates with spending per student.
	* **Scores by School Size**: Assess how school size impacts student performance.
	* **Scores by School Type**: Investigate performance trends based on the type of school (Charter vs. District).
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The ultimate aim is to provide the school board and mayor with actionable insights derived from the data. This involves identifying trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions on resource allocation, policy-making, and prioritizing initiatives for the overall enhancement of the district's educational standards.

This comprehensive analysis is intended not only to reflect the current state of the school district but also to highlight areas for potential growth and improvement, ensuring that every decision made contributes positively to the educational journey of each student in the district.

## Implementation
This section outlines the key steps taken in the PyCity Schools Analysis
### District Summary
#### Date Preparation and Merging
```python
# Import pandas library
import pandas as pd

# File paths for school and student data
school_data_file = '../Resources/schools_complete.csv'
student_data_file = '../Resources/students_complete.csv'

# Load files into DataFrames
school_data = pd.read_csv(school_data_file)
student_data = pd.read_csv(student_data_file)

# Merge student and school data on 'school_name' and display results
school_data_complete = pd.merge(student_data, school_data, how='left', on=['school_name', 'school_name'])
school_data_complete.head()
```
The process begins with the `pandas` library being imported for data handling. School and student data, sourced from CSV files, are loaded into separate DataFrames. These datasets are then merged into a single DataFrame, `school_data_complete`, based on the `school_name` column. 
#### Calculating the Total Number of Unique Schools
```python
# Calculate the total number of unique schools
school_count = school_data_complete['school_name'].nunique()
school_count
```
The unique count of schools is determined using the `nunique()` method on the `school_name` column of the `school_data_complete` DataFrame.
#### Calculating the Total Number of Students
```python
# Calculate the total number of students
student_count = school_data_complete['student_name'].count()
student_count
```
The total number of students is calculated by applying the `count()` method to the `student_name` column of the `school_data_complete` DataFrame.
#### Calculating the Total Budget
```python
# Calculate the total budget
total_budget = school_data['budget'].sum()
total_budget
```
The overall budget for all schools is computed by summing the values in the `budget` column of the `school_data` DataFrame.
#### Calculating the Average Math Score
```python
# Calculate the average (mean) math score
average_math_score = school_data_complete['math_score'].mean()
average_math_score
```
The average math score across the student body is calculated using the `mean()` method on the `math_score` column in the `school_data_complete` DataFrame.
#### Calculating the Average Reading Score
```python
# Calculate the average (mean) reading score
average_reading_score = school_data_complete['reading_score'].mean()
average_reading_score
```
The average reading score is calculated by applying the `mean()` method to the `reading_score` column in the `school_data_complete` DataFrame.
#### Calculating the Percentage of Students Passing Math
```python
# Calculate the percentage of students who passed math (math scores greater than or equal to 70)
passing_math_count = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["math_score"] >= 70)].count()["student_name"]
passing_math_percentage = passing_math_count / float(student_count) * 100
passing_math_percentage
```
The percentage of students passing math is calculated by identifying scores ≥ 70 in `math_score` and expressing this count as a percentage of total students.
#### Calculating the Percentage of Students Passing Reading
```python
# Calculate the percentage of students who passed reading
passing_reading_count = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["reading_score"] >= 70)].count()["student_name"]
passing_reading_percentage = passing_reading_count / float(student_count) * 100
passing_reading_percentage
```
The percentage of students passing reading is calculated by identifying scores ≥ 70 in `reading_score` and expressing this count as a percentage of total students.
#### Percentage of Students Passing Both Math and Reading
```python
# Calculate the percentage of students that passed math and reading
passing_math_reading_count = school_data_complete[
    (school_data_complete["math_score"] >= 70) & (school_data_complete["reading_score"] >= 70)
].count()["student_name"]
overall_passing_rate = passing_math_reading_count /  float(student_count) * 100
overall_passing_rate
```
The percentage of students passing both math and reading is computed by identifying those who scored ≥ 70 in both subjects and then calculating this group's proportion relative to the total student count.
#### Creation of District Summary DataFrame
```python
# Create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame
district_summary = pd.DataFrame([{
    "Total Shools": school_count,
    "Total Students": student_count,
    "Total Budget": total_budget,
    "Average Math Score": average_math_score,
    "Average Reading Score": average_reading_score,
    "% Passing Math": passing_math_percentage,
    "% Passing Reading": passing_reading_percentage,
    "% Overall Passing": overall_passing_rate
}])

# Formatting
district_summary["Total Students"] = district_summary["Total Students"].map("{:,}".format)
district_summary["Total Budget"] = district_summary["Total Budget"].map("${:,.2f}".format)

# Display the DataFrame
district_summary
```
A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics is compiled into a DataFrame named `district_summary`. This DataFrame includes total schools, students, budget, average scores, and passing percentages, with formatting applied to enhance readability.
### School Summary
#### Selecting School Types
```python
# Select the school type
school_types = school_data.set_index(["school_name"])["type"]
school_types
```
The script extracts the types of each school, setting `school_name` as the index and selecting the `type` column from the `school_data` DataFrame.
#### Calculating Total Student Count per School
```python
# Calculate the total student count
per_school_counts = school_data_complete.groupby('school_name')['student_name'].count()
per_school_counts
```
The total number of students for each school is calculated by grouping `school_data_complete` by `school_name` and counting `student_name` entries.
#### Calculating School Budgets and Per Capita Spending
```python
# Calculate the total school budget and per capita spending
per_school_budget = school_data_complete.groupby(["school_name"]).mean(numeric_only=True)["budget"]
per_school_capita = per_school_budget / per_school_counts
```
The script computes each school's total budget and per capita spending by grouping `school_data_complete` by `school_name`, averaging the `budget`, and then dividing by the student count per school.
#### Calculating Average Test Scores per School
```python
# Calculate the average test scores
per_school_math = school_data_complete.groupby('school_name')['math_score'].mean()
per_school_reading = school_data_complete.groupby('school_name')['reading_score'].mean()
```
The average math and reading scores for each school are calculated by grouping `school_data_complete` by `school_name` and computing the mean of `math_score` and `reading_score`, respectively.
#### Schools with Math Scores of 70 or Higher
```python
# Calculate the number of schools with math scores of 70 or higher
school_passing_math = school_data_complete[school_data_complete["math_score"] >= 70]
```
Schools where students have achieved math scores of 70 or higher are identified from `school_data_complete` using a conditional filter on `math_score`.
#### Schools with Reading Scores of 70 or Higher
```python
# Calculate the number of schools with reading scores of 70 or higher
school_passing_reading = school_data_complete[school_data_complete["reading_score"] >= 70]
```
Schools with students achieving reading scores of 70 or higher are determined by filtering `school_data_complete` based on `reading_score`.
#### Identifying Schools Passing Both Math and Reading
```python
# Calculate the schools that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher
passing_math_and_reading = school_data_complete[
    (school_data_complete["reading_score"] >= 70) & (school_data_complete["math_score"] >= 70)
]
```
Schools where students passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher are identified by applying a combined filter to `school_data_complete` on both `math_score` and `reading_score`.
#### Calculating Passing Rates for Each School
```python
# Calculate the passing rates
per_school_passing_math = school_passing_math.groupby(["school_name"]).count()["student_name"] / per_school_counts * 100
per_school_passing_reading = school_passing_reading.groupby(["school_name"]).count()["student_name"] / per_school_counts * 100
overall_passing_rate = passing_math_and_reading.groupby(["school_name"]).count()["student_name"] / per_school_counts * 100
```
The passing rates for math and reading are computed by dividing the count of students who passed in each subject by the total student count per school, then multiplying by 100. Similarly, the overall passing rate is determined by the proportion of students passing both math and reading.
#### Creating the School Summary DataFrame
```python
# Create a DataFrame called `per_school_summary` with columns for the calculations above.
per_school_summary = pd.DataFrame({
    "School Type": school_types,
    "Total Students": per_school_counts,
    "Total School Budget": per_school_budget,
    "Per Student Budget": per_school_capita,
    "Average Math Score": per_school_math,
    "Average Reading Score": per_school_reading,
    "% Passing Math": per_school_passing_math,
    "% Passing Reading": per_school_passing_reading,
    "% Overall Passing": overall_passing_rate
})

# Formatting
per_school_summary["Total School Budget"] = per_school_summary["Total School Budget"].map("${:,.2f}".format)
per_school_summary["Per Student Budget"] = per_school_summary["Per Student Budget"].map("${:,.2f}".format)

# Reset index and display the DataFrame
per_school_summary.reset_index(inplace=True)
per_school_summary
```
A DataFrame named `per_school_summary` is created, encapsulating key metrics such as school type, student counts, budgets, average scores, and passing rates. It includes formatting for budget values and resets the index for clearer presentation.
