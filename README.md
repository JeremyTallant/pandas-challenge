![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112406455/210904891-7c74c3e9-fe27-491c-b019-5276e1887814.png)

## Background
As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I am tasked with analyzing district-wide standardized test results to aid strategic decision-making regarding school budgets and priorities. Utilizing Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, my assignment is to create detailed reports based on every student's math and reading scores, along with school information. The objective is to aggregate this data effectively to reveal clear trends in school performance. This analysis will help in creating a comprehensive snapshot of the district's educational landscape, encompassing various key metrics like average scores, passing percentages, and budget allocations. The insights gained will be pivotal in guiding the school board and mayor's decisions, ensuring resource allocation aligns with the areas of greatest need and impact.
## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to utilize advanced data manipulation techniques with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to conduct a thorough analysis of standardized test results across the school district. The key objectives are outlined as follows:
1. **District Summary**: To compute and present a high-level snapshot of the district's key educational metrics, including the total number of schools, students, overall budget, average scores, and percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
2. **School Summary**: To create a detailed report for each school, covering metrics such as school type, total students, budget allocations, average scores, and passing rates. This will provide a clear understanding of each school's performance within the district.
3. **Performance Analysis by Various Criteria**:
	* **Highest-Performing Schools**: Identify and list the top schools based on overall passing rates.
	* **Lowest-Performing Schools**: Determine schools that need the most attention and improvement.
	* **Math and Reading Scores by Grade**: Analyze average scores in math and reading across different grade levels for each school.
	* **Scores by School Spending**: Examine how school performance correlates with spending per student.
	* **Scores by School Size**: Assess how school size impacts student performance.
	* **Scores by School Type**: Investigate performance trends based on the type of school (Charter vs. District).
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The ultimate aim is to provide the school board and mayor with actionable insights derived from the data. This involves identifying trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions on resource allocation, policy-making, and prioritizing initiatives for the overall enhancement of the district's educational standards.

This comprehensive analysis is intended not only to reflect the current state of the school district but also to highlight areas for potential growth and improvement, ensuring that every decision made contributes positively to the educational journey of each student in the district.
## Data
This project utilizes two primary data sources in CSV format, focusing on the educational landscape of various schools and their student performance. These datasets have been generated by [Mockaroo, LLC (2022)](https://mockaroo.com/) under the title "Realistic Data Generator" and are intended for educational purposes only. The data creation is credited to edX Boot Camps LLC.

### Schools Data (`schools_complete.csv`)

The schools dataset provides a foundation for analyzing the distribution of schools by type, their sizes, and budget allocations. The students dataset is crucial for evaluating student performance in different subjects across various schools and grades. Together, they offer a comprehensive view of the structure of the school system and the academic achievements of its students. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the effectiveness of different school types and identify areas for improvement in student education.
